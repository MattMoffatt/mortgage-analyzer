# Mortgage Analyzer

A Streamlit application for analyzing current mortgages and comparing refinance or new purchase scenarios.

All of the visualization code was written by Claude AI. This was a learning project for me to understand OOP
and streamlit better and I had no desire to also spend the time to learn how to build python visualizations.

## Data Flow

1. Users input their current mortgage details in the "ðŸ’¸ Current Mortgage" page
2. Users create a new mortgage scenario (refinance option coming) in the "ðŸ†• New Scenario" page
3. The "ðŸ“ˆ Comparison" page analyzes and visualizes the differences between the current mortgage and the new scenario
4. All mortgage calculations are handled by the core classes in `src/models/`

## How to run app

1. Clone or fork the repo in your desired location
2. Create a virtual environment for your project and install the necessary dependencies with
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Either navigate into the `app/` directory and run 
```bash
streamlit run home_page.py
```
Or, in the `mortgage-analyzer/` directory run
```bash
streamlit run app/home_page.py
```

## Future Additions/Updates

* "ðŸ†• New Scenario" page:
    - add "Refinance" tab widgets and calculation code

* "ðŸ“ˆ Comparison" page:
    - Refactor comparison calculation logic to effectively evaluate Refinance opportunities vs. new purchases
